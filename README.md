# Crop-recommendation-system
The primary objective of a Crop Recommendation System using Machine Learning Models and
Environmental Factors is to assist farmers and agricultural practitioners in making informed decisions
about which crops to cultivate in a specific region or field based on environmental conditions and
other relevant factors. 

To predict the crop yield, selected
Machine Learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and K-
Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Naive bayes, Decision Tree are used.

## Dataset Description
Precision agriculture is in trend nowadays. It helps the farmers to get informed decision about the farming strategy. Here, I present you a dataset which would allow the users to build a predictive model to recommend the most suitable crops to grow in a particular farm based on various parameters.

### Dataset 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atharvaingle/crop-recommendation-dataset

The data has 2200 rows of 8 variables

## Variable - Details
N - ratio of Nitrogen content in soil

P - ratio of Phosphorous content in soil

K - ratio of Potassium content in soil

temperature - temperature in degree Celsius

humidity - relative humidity in %

ph - ph value of the soil

rainfall - rainfall in mm

## Project Flow
We will handle this problem in a structured way.
